# Diabetes Prediction

This work is my small project related to Machine learning. This 
project is diabetes prediction. All programming is in Python using 
Jupyter Notebook. Since the project is a classification type problem, 
we have used logistic regression model which is the supervised 
learning algorithm.


## The workflow 

First of all, we need to collect the diabetes data. We must preprocess 
the data where we shall try to analyse the data. This data is not suitable
to feed to the machine learning model, and we should standardise the
data because there are many attributes, and we would like all these
data to be in the same range. After that, the data will be split 
into the training and test data. Then, we will feed the dataset of
diabetes data to our Support Vector Machine model.

We will use the classification model because the target of this project
is to classify whether the patient is diabetic and non-diabetic.

Thus, the workflow is shown by the following process:

- Diabetes Data --> Data preprocessing --> Train test split --> Support Vector Machine Classifier 
- New Data --> Trained Support Vector Machine Classifier --> Prediction: Diabetic or Non-diabetic
